# Raffle

This is a simple raffle script. I use this when i am hungry but can't decide which food to order.

## Installing

- The script has no dependencies.

- Make sure you have python 3 installed and the python path added to system environment variables.

- After that click the green button that says "Clone or download" on the project github page. You can clone the project if you know how to use git or just simply click "Download ZIP" button.

## Usage

- Navigate the downloaded folder on the command line.

Type:
```shell
raffle.py
```
